# Later Hater

## Background and Overview
Later Hater is a game with visuals modeled after the Vaporwave Aesthetic. Players will be able to teleport to places on the board to avoid 'haters' coming towards them. The catch: Every time you make a move, a brand new hater is lurking in the corner, waiting to ruin your good time.

## Functionality and MVPs
Players can click on a point in the map and their icon will appear there. Haters will generate and move towards the player. Teleportation ability refresh will limit teleports. Score will increase the longer a player lasts.
